# Face Attendance System with Liveness Detection

###### This project implements a Face Attendance System using computer vision techniques to automate attendance tracking. It includes a liveness detection feature to prevent spoofing attacks, ensuring security and reliability.

## Features
###### Face Detection and Recognition: Detects and identifies individuals in real-time.
###### Liveness Detection: Differentiates live subjects from spoofing attempts (e.g., photos or videos).
###### Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on multiple platforms with Python 3.8+.
###### Customizable Dataset: Train the system with your dataset for personalized use.

## Usage
#### Run the System:
###### python main.py

#### Add New Faces:
###### Place images of new individuals in the dataset folder.
###### Retrain the system if needed.

#### Real-Time Attendance:
###### Use a webcam or an external camera to detect and recognize faces.

## Tools and Libraries
###### Python 3.8+
###### OpenCV: For face detection and image processing.
###### face_recognition: For deep learning-based face embeddings.
###### NumPy: For numerical computations.
